# Introduction

A C++ project that implements a spellcheck system that can output whether an entered word is correct or not. A trie data structure is used to store a dictionary of words and words can be added and removed from this dictionary. This data structure allows for many words to be stored with minimal memory required and spellchecked with a minimimal runtime.
